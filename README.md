# SudokuSoltutionValidator
The goal of this project is to solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle using two approaches.
One using the multithreaded approach and the other one using a single thread approach. After the execution using both the approaches, whether the Sudoku is valid or not is found out and execution time is also calculated. Based on this execution time, an analysis is made regarding which approach was better for solving this problem.
